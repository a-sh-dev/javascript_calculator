# 🧮 (VANILLA) JAVASCRIPT CALCULATOR

----

This project is created to deepen `JavaScript` fundamentals and the `DOM`s. Built together with `HTML5` and `CSS3`. 

This project is based on Justin Kim's iPhone calculator tutorial. I modified it to be responsive and tweak it slightly to limit any long decimal values to fit the calculator screen.
