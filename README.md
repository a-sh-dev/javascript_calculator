# 🧮 (VANILLA) JAVASCRIPT CALCULATOR

----

This project is created to deepen `JavaScript` fundamentals and the `DOM`. Built together with `HTML5` and `CSS3`. 

This project is based on Justin Kim's iPhone calculator [tutorial](https://youtu.be/h6UPzVj1ncI). I modified it to be responsive, optimised it by refactoring the codes and tweaked it slightly to limit any long decimal values to fit the calculator screen.
